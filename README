This jQuery plugin faciliates the classic two-column left/right picker. The plugin operates on a specified UL. The following
html fragment is an example:

<div id="picker">
	<ul id="pickerDataSource">
		<li value="1">Item 1</li>
		<li value="2">Item 2</li>
		<li value="3">Item 3</li>
    </ul>
</div>

A full working example is contained in the picker.html file, which is in the root of the project on github. 

The following code invokes the picker against the aforementioned UL"

$("#pickerDataSource").picker();

In some cases, you will have pre-selected items. The following code will move id's 1 and 2 to the selected list:

$("#pickerDataSource").picker({selectedItems: [1,2]});

This plugin is fully ThemeRoller compatable. The themes ui-lightness, ui-darkness and sunny are included as examples. Simply change the css 
reference in the example picker.html page and you will see plugin change accordingly. 

There are a battery of tests in the /tests folder.


Enjoy...
